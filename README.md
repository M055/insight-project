# Meeple for People


In this project I built a board game recommendation system that combines a more "traditional" feature-based recommendation with an NLP-driven, *semantics-based* recommendation.

#### What are meeple?
![A meeple](https://github.com/M055/insight-project/blob/master/other/meeplered.png)
[Meeple:](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meeple) - are small person-shaped figures used as players' tokens in some board games. 


# What is the context of this project?

Quite by chance, you and your friends recently discovered the game [Wingspan](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan) and enjoyed playing it. You want to find other games that are similar to Wingspan. What does *similar* mean? 

What you are looking for is a **recommender**. Traditionally, recommenders rely on patterns of engagements between users and products (movies, books, etc), and on surface features of products such as genre, length, or author.

In this project, I explore a new kind of recommender, which looks at similarities between products -- games -- in terms of similarities in how you would describe a game to someone else. That is, I am interested in building a recommender that can understand something about the semantics (meaning) of descriptions of different games, and determine similarity in relation to the similarity of these descriptions.
